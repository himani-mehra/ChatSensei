## 🧩 What is Chat Sensei?

It's a frontend web app that lets you:

- Type a question or prompt into a neat input box
- Stream real-time responses from an AI (so it looks like it's typing back)
- See a history of everything you've asked
- Toggle the history panel to keep your view clean

It's minimal. It's snappy. And it just works.

- **Vanilla JavaScript** – no frameworks
- **Groq API** using the **LLaMA 3 model** (llama3-8b-8192) for responses
- Designed to be mobile-friendly
